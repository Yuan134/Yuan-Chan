DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

1. Institute of Data (IOD) Capstone Project: 

Capstone project on Sarcasm Detection using NLP (Kaggle Dataset containing Reddit postings) completed over the span of 2 weeks.

The project folder contains a project report and coding (in 5 parts):-

    Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  
    Part 2. Modelling using conventional Machine Learning Approaches
  
    Part 3a. Deep learning approach using Multi-Layer Perceptron (Feed forward neural network)
  
    Part 3b. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and BLSTM 
  
    Part 3c. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and BLSTM with finetuning

2. Institute of Data (IOD) Mini-Project:

Project on prediction of Australian Rainfall using a Kaggle Dataset.

This project examines the importance of various features in predicting rainfall as wellas approaches for statistical imputation of missing values and under / over-sampling (including SMOTE) to handle dataset imbalance.
