# SELF-GUIDED DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

### 1. Institute of Data (IOD) Capstone Project: 

Capstone project on Sarcasm Detection using NLP (Kaggle Dataset containing Reddit postings) completed over the span of 2 weeks.

The project folder contains a project report and coding (in 5 parts):-

    Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  
    Part 2. Modelling using conventional Machine Learning Approaches
  
    Part 3a. Deep learning approach using Multi-Layer Perceptron (Feed forward neural network)
  
    Part 3b. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) 
  
    Part 3c. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and BLSTM with finetuning


### 2. Institute of Data (IOD) Mini-Project 1:

Project on "Significant global earthquakes occurring from 2150 BC to present" - dataset from Google BigQuery public datasets

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis including cleaning cleaning, wrangling,munging and visualisation of important features of global earthquakes extracted from a publicly available dataset using the Google BigQuery API.


### 3. Institute of Data (IOD) Mini-Project 2:

Project on "Prediction of Australian Rainfall" using a Kaggle Dataset.

This project examines the importance of various features in predicting rainfall as well as approaches for statistical imputation of missing values and under / over-sampling (including SMOTE) to handle dataset imbalance.


# SELF GUIDED DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS CODING PROJECTS IN PYTHON

Unguided projects for data structures and algorithms using Python coding. 
Refer to attached README and Analysis Reports for a summary of results and insights.

### 1. Lab1
Python module to convert Prefix notation into Postfix notation using a Stack ADT using singly linked list implementation

### 2. Lab2
Python module to convert Prefix notation into Postfix notation using: a) Direct recursive approach b) Binary tree based recursive approach

### 3. Lab3
Python module to employ Huffman encoding / decoding. Includes module to convert a corpus text into a Huffman Frequency table

### 4. Lab4
Python module to compare Quick Sort algorithm against Natural Merge Sort against datasets containing various sizes (up to 3000) randomly generated integers
