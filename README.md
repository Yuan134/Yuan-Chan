DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

1. Institute of Data (IOD) Capstone Project: 

Capstone project on Sarcasm Detection using NLP (Kaggle Dataset containing Reddit postings) completed over the span of 2 weeks.

The project folder contains a project report and coding (in 5 parts):-

    Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  
    Part 2. Modelling using conventional Machine Learning Approaches
  
    Part 3a. Deep learning approach using Multi-Layer Perceptron (Feed forward neural network)
  
    Part 3b. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) 
  
    Part 3c. Deep learning approach using BERT Transformer and BLSTM with finetuning

2. Institute of Data (IOD) Mini-Project 1:

Project on "Significant global earthquakes occurring from 2150 BC to present" - dataset from Google BigQuery public datasets

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis including cleaning cleaning, wrangling,munging and visualisation of important features of global earthquakes extracted from a publicly available dataset using the Google BigQuery API.

3. Institute of Data (IOD) Mini-Project 2:

Project on "Prediction of Australian Rainfall" using a Kaggle Dataset.

This project examines the importance of various features in predicting rainfall as well as approaches for statistical imputation of missing values and under / over-sampling (including SMOTE) to handle dataset imbalance.

4. IOD Miscellaneous Lab Exercises (Lab 3):

Sample assignment lab exercises for the following:
- SQL 
- MongoDB
- Google BigQuery
- API interactions
