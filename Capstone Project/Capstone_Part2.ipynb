    "\n",
    "## Overview and Project objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate a subset of 1.3 million comments (150000) from the Internet commentary website Reddit) through **supervised learning machine learning approaches (both conventional and deep learning algorithms)** to predict the occurence of sarcastic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation will undertake feature engineering for potential extraction of sarcastic markers and attempt to address both text meta-features as well as the context of comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional machine learning approaches (contained in this notebook) will address the text from the \"comment\" feature in the dataset. The \"parent comment\" or context of the comment in question will be addressed indirectly through the use of meta-features such as cosine similarity and sentiment polarity with the \"comment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning (contained in separate notebooks) algorithms will accept the direct input of both the \"comment\" and \"parent comment\" texts for processing and identification of prediction features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit containing the \\s ( sarcasm) tag. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is 50/50 balanced. (True ratio is about 1:100). The corpus has 1.3 million comments ('comment'), along with what they responded to ('parent comment').\n",
    "\n",
    "10 columns of features - refer Dataset features below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labelled comments (balanced dataset) are in the train-balanced-sarcasm.csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements:\n",

    "**COMMENT** is the user posted text that is being labelled with the target 0 (Non-Sarcastic) or 1 (Sarcastic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PARENT COMMENT** is the original comment that **COMMENT** is responding to. In this investigation, this is the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUBREDDIT** Subreddits are dedicated to a particular topic that people write about e.g. gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UPVOTE** is a method on the website Reddit by which users can signal their approval or support for a post. Upvotes move a post towards the top of the site, and they are a way to measure how many people approve of the content that is in a post.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DOWNVOTE** is an action that a user can take on the Reddit website (and in some other user interfaces) that is used to signal disapproval or try to downgrade a post and its content\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCORE** is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not \"real\" numbers, they have been \"fuzzed\" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are \"fuzzed\"."

    "\"*Lemmatization is a critical step in a number of tasks, but there are times in which it is not appropriate. Some applications decisively benefit from lemmatization. Topic modeling, for example, relies on the distribution of content words, the identification of which is dependent on a string match between words, which is achieved by lemmatizing their forms so that all variants are consistent across documents. TD-IDF and LDA therefore both benefit in general from lemmatization. Lemmatization is also important for training word vectors, since accurate counts within the window of a word would be disrupted by an irrelevant inflection like a simple plural or present tense inflection.*\"\n",

    "Lemmatization has been investigated and found to increase accuracy slightly in TFIDF vectorization results but the increase is not significant. Lemmatization will be incorporated into the text entries in this notebook."
